# Battle mode Considerations

## Player interactions during a battle

Situation:

A participant within a battle, might leave at any time, for example due to a disconnection from internet.

Proposal:

Adding feature to create a battle using interactions, such as the usage of card boosters.
In order to prevent misuse of this feature, players do agree that battle continues.
