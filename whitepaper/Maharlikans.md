# Maharlikans

## Introduction

Maharlika is defacto the former name of the [Republic of the Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines).

It names a martial class of freemen/freedmen in Luzon, the biggest island of the Philippines.

Since many years, there are ongoing discussions, to change the name of the Philippines, back to Maharlika.
Mainly because the name "Philippines", is always a reminder of 300 years of colonial rule, instead of the cultural inheritance.
