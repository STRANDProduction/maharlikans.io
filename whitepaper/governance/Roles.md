# Governance - Roles

## Introduction
Maharlikans governance is strictly role driven, to ensure that not one single entity has the sole full power of the Maharlikans token.

## Overview

### Election committee
Anyone, which owns a certain amount of Maharlikans token, can apply for a particular role.
Every such application will go through the process of an off-chain review by the election committee,
which can either refuse application or create a request for an electional voting.

The election committee is the only entity, which can create an electional poll.

### Voting committee
The voting committee is formed by electing nominees through the election committee.
Anyone, which owns a certain amount of Maharlikans token, can initiate a poll request.
Every poll requests will go through the process of an off-chain review by the voting committee,
which can either refuse poll request or create a poll.

Types of votings:
- General/Advisory poll
- Electional poll (only the election committee, can create this kind of poll)
- Mint poll
- Burn poll

### Owner
Maharlikans token, unlike the majority of other tokens, has not the one single owner, which has the sole full power of all features.
It is driven by this role system.

Mahalikans token are by definition, burnable and mintable but in fact, neither the token creator, nor a member of the Owner role, can mint or burn tokens.
The minting and burning process, is solely based on the result of a mint respectively burn poll.
